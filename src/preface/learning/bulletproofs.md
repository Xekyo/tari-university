## Background

Bulletproofs are short non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs that require no trusted setup. A bulletproof can be used to convince a verifier that an encrypted plaintext is well formed. For example, prove that an encrypted number is in a given range, without revealing anything else about the number.

## Learning Path Matrix 

For learning purposes, we have arranged report, presentation and video topics in a matrix, in categories of difficulty, interest and format.
