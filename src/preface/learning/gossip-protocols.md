## Background

A gossip protocol is a procedure or process of computer peer-to-peer communication that is based on the way epidemics spread. Some distributed systems use peer-to-peer gossip to ensure that data is routed to all members of an ad-hoc network. Some ad-hoc networks have no central registry and the only way to spread common data is to rely on each member to pass it along to their neighbors.

## Learning Path Matrix 

For learning purposes, we have arranged report, presentation and video topics in a matrix, in categories of difficulty, interest and format.
