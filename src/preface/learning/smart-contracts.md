## Background

Smart contracts allow for implementing user-defined operations of arbitrary complexity that are not possible through plain crytocurrency protocols. They allow users to implement conditions, rules and policies of the domain applications. Smart contracts are a powerful feature that, when properly designed and coded, can result in autonomous, effieicent and transparent systems.
